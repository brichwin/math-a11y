# math-a11y

This GitHub repository is focused on advancing the reading and writing of mathematics for persons with disabilities. Blind and low vision users are the target audience. We will work to make sure the Reading Systems, browsers, and authoring tools 
perform as expected. We will engage with the authoring tool , Reading Systems, and Assistive Technology (AT) developers to improve the experience.

In addition, we will identify the training and support materials needed for end users to advance their skills in mathematics. Where these resources already exist, we will reference them. When there are materials not available, we will create those resources.

We plan to collaborate with other groups working on the advancement of mathematics for persons with disabilities.

## Communications

We are using a DAISY mailing list for our communications.

Email list is: <math@daisylists.org>

[To sign up to the DAISY Math list discussing reading and writing accessible math, fill out this simple form.](https://daisylists.org/postorius/lists/math.daisylists.org/)

We are also using a SharePoint folder for documents. Members can request this link.

## Projects

We plan to work on a number of projects associated with the reading and writing of math. We will list them here:

### Microsoft Word 365

We are collaborating with developers at Microsoft: [Project: Digital Math in Microsoft Word 365 Accessibility](https://daisy.github.io/math-a11y/docs/ms-math/)

If you are posting a message to the mailing list and want to focus on this project, please begin the email's subject line with "[MS-Math]"

## Submitting Issues

The Daisy/math A11y subgroup is discovering issues with the Microsoft Equation Editor, and those issues will go through a process described below:

1. The issue is discovered and submitted on the [Issues page for our group](https://github.com/daisy/math-a11y/issues).
2. Another person verifies that the issue exists for them as well.
3. Depending on what the issue is, it is reported to 
   - [Microsoft eDAD](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/enterprise-answer-desk)  
   - Freedom Scientific, or submitted to the [MathCat GitHub](https://github.com/NSoiffer/MathCAT).
